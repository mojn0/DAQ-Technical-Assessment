This file is used to document your thoughts, approaches and research conducted across all tasks in the Technical Assessment.

## Firmware

Added the library dbcppp to the firmware, was confused about how to do this, but a simple search led me to git's own website where they stated that you could add a submodule with the command:
```
$ git submodule add [URL]
```

Added dbcppp to the CMakeLists file, not sure if its correct or not, i simply copied how solution was added to the Lists file.

Added Dockerfile to support dbcppp, had to search up what Docker was, since i was not familiar with it at all.
